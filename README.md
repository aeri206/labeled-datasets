- This repository contains 96 labeled datasets in both numpy and compressed (.bin) formats.
- The datasets are collected initially as a candidate for external clustering validation but still can be used for various purposes (e.g., classification, dimensionality reduction...)
- For detailed information about each dataset, refer to our [website](https://hyeonword.com/clm-datasets/).
